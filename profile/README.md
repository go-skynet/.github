## Hi there 👋

Welcome to the go-skynet's org!

Go-skynet is a community-driven organization. It was initially created by [mudler](https://github.com/mudler/) at the [SpectroCloud OSS office](https://github.com/spectrocloud).

go-skynet goal is to enable anyone democratize and run AI locally. [LocalAI](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI) is a REST API that allows any software written for OpenAI to use local inferencing models instead. 
Uses [ggml](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml), [gpt4all](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all) and [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) to encompass all model types under an unified API.

Feel free to open issues, ask questions, and open up PRs!
